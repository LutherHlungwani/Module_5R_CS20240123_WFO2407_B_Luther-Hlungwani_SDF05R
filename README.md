# [SDF05] CSS Magic Buttons

As required from activity, I used CSS to style and animate 3 buttons ine the following ways:

## button 1 (.btn-1)
I changed the font-size and weight.
I added color and a 5px box-shadow bottom.
And made it so that on-click, the box-shadow would disappear, simulating a pushed-down effect as a physical button.

## button 2 (.btn-2)

I changed the font-weight and font-size.
Gave it color.
I made the :hover effect that the button would have texture by giving it box-shadow on the right and at the bottom. The baackground color and text color will also trade place when hovering the button
On-click, the button will have no box-shadow simulating the same pushed-down effect as .btn-1 

## button 3 (button 3)
I gave button 3 a larger border.
Then when hovering the button, there a touch of white light that translates the button. I used a @keyframes animation to accomplish this transition of light beeing eased-in from the left to the right of the button.
I aslo adjusted the color to make the transition easier to spot as it glosses over the button.
